#What is ConTeXt

ConTeXt is software for typesetting high-quality documents. Unlike familiar word processors where the formatting of the final document is crafted while writing the content, ConTeXt documents are written without formatting, in plain text, using a macro language. This means that the document's content can change independently of its formatting and vice versa.
